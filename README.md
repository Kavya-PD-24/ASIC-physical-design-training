Hands-on training project on ASIC design flow and physical design using Synopsys tools (Design Compiler, ICC2, PrimeTime, StarRC).
# ASIC Physical Design Training Project

## Overview
This repository contains my training project on **ASIC Physical Design flow** as part of hands-on training using Synopsys tools.  
The project demonstrates the complete **RTL-to-GDSII implementation flow**, including synthesis, placement, routing, and timing closure.

## Tools Used
- Synopsys Design Compiler (Synthesis)  
- Synopsys ICC2 (Placement & Routing)  
- Synopsys PrimeTime (Static Timing Analysis)  
- Synopsys StarRC (Parasitic Extraction)  

## Technology Nodes
- 28nm and 14nm technology nodes

## Key Learnings
- Floorplanning and power planning  
- Placement and Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)  
- Routing and optimization for PPA (Power, Performance, Area)  
- Static Timing Analysis (STA) and Timing Closure  
- Parasitic Extraction (PEX) and Signoff  

## Outcome
- Successfully executed the **full RTL to GDSII flow** on test designs  
- Achieved timing closure and optimization across advanced technology nodes
